We are using chiptune3.js to output tracker music.

+++ Make bars of equalizer larger but not change width of the equalizer canvas, so markup will not be broken
 
- Current state: Upon selecting any playlist (.left li), a random track begins automatic playback, after it's completion playback stops. It is not desired behavior.  

Desired behavior:  Upon selecting any playlist (.left li), a random track begins automatic playback, after completion of this initial track, all remaining tracks within the selected playlist will play sequentially. If the shuffle option (handleShuffle) is enabled, these tracks will be played in random order; otherwise, tracks follow their default order in playlist until reach the end of it upon which playback halts automatically.


+++ The handlePlayPause button currently works as follows: if the music is playing and the button is pressed, it stops playback (which is correct behavior); 
however, at the same time there is a visual switching of both the active track indicator (tracks li.active) and the track pointer icon (.track-icon) to another track. 
When the handlePlayPause button is clicked again, the current song resumes its playback (as intended), but once more, the visual indicators (tracks li.active) and (.track-icon) are switched again. Pressing handlePlayPause should not result in any GUI track changes, meaning that elements like (tracks li.active) or (.track-icon) should remain unaffected.

+++  With the loop feature (handleLoop) turned on, the player ensures continuous sequential playback of each track in the chosen playlist. This means that after completing all tracks in the playlist, playback restarts from the first track without interruption. If shuffle mode (handleShuffle) is also activated during this process, infinite playback occurs in random sequence without repetition.

+++ If music is currently being played, pressing either handlePrev or handleNext must allow navigation between tracks backward and forward respectively, updating the corresponding states (tracks li.active) and (.track-icon).

+++ Now the track change buttons are malfunctioning, specifically the previous track / next track buttons (handlePrev / handleNext). 
Currently, they only visually switch the active track (tracks li.active) and the arrow indicating the active track (.track-icon), but the actual track itself does not change.

+++ If a user manually selects a specific track by clicking on it (.tracks li.active), playback for that particular track starts immediately. Once finished, continue playlist playback according to settings defined by the handleShuffle and handleLoop buttons.
